This project contains seven buttons corresponding to the seven musical notes A-G in the 4th octave. Frequencies were chosen 
based on the frequency values provided on the table from http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html. The volume can be adjusted using the rotary potentiometer.

Parts:
  -7 Button switches
  -8ohm/.1 watt speaker
  -NPN transistor
  -Potentiometer
  -10k ohm resistor
  -Arduino board
  
Frequency values (in Hertz):
  A: 440
  B: 494
  C: 262
  D: 294
  E: 329
  F: 349
  G: 392
